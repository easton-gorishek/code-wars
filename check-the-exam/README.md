## Problem Domain
* Check/compare an array that holds the answers to an exam with an array that contains the student's answers. Award four points for each correct answer, minus one point for each incorrect answer, and zero points for blank answers. 

## Whiteboard
* I worked alone at home on this challenge. I knew I needed to iterate through each array and use comparative operators within conditional statements to check answers.
